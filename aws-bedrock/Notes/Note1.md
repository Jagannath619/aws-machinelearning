## 📘 What is Amazon Bedrock?

**Amazon Bedrock** is a service from AWS that provides an **API endpoint** (application programming interface) to interact with pre‑trained **generative AI models**.

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Multiple Model Providers**: Choose from a variety of models by leading providers, selecting the best fit for your use case.
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage — reducing operational overhead.
- **Fast Start**: Get up and running in minutes, accelerating development and reducing time-to-market.

Security is top of mind:

- **Encryption by Default**: Your data, prompts, and responses are always encrypted.
- **Data Isolation**: Your data is **never used** to train or retrain the base model.
- **Privacy**: Your data is never visible to anyone but you.

Bedrock integrates with:

- **Amazon VPC**
- **AWS PrivateLink**: A private network that keeps data off the public internet.

## 🗂️ Using Your Own Data

You can store your custom data in **Amazon S3**, and Bedrock can use it to answer questions. This gives **you full control** over the data referenced during inference.
