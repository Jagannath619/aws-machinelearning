# Selecting a Foundation Model on Amazon Bedrock

Welcome to this guide on how to choose the most suitable Foundation Model (FM) for your specific Generative AI requirements using Amazon Bedrock.

## Introduction

Selecting the right Foundation Model is not a "one-size-fits-all" scenario. Each use case has unique requirements, and Amazon Bedrock empowers you to choose from a diverse selection of models from industry-leading AI startups. This flexibility ensures you can find the model that best aligns with your needs and priorities.

## Amazon Bedrock: Your Flexible Foundation Model Hub

Amazon Bedrock offers a wide range of models, categorized by their capabilities and cost-effectiveness:

* **Affordable, Compact Models:** Ideal for simple queries and cost-sensitive applications.
* **Balanced Price & Performance Models:** Offer a good equilibrium for general-purpose tasks.
* **High-Performance Models:** Designed for complex tasks requiring advanced capabilities.

**Key Advantage: Seamless Model Switching**

With Amazon Bedrock's single API, you gain the unprecedented flexibility to:

* **Switch between different models:** Experiment and optimize your choice with minimal code adjustments.

This agility is crucial in a field where new models and versions are released frequently, providing you with a significant competitive advantage.

## Model Selection Criteria

The selection of a model is highly dependent on your specific use case. Consider the following key criteria when evaluating Foundation Models:

* **Required Capabilities:**
    * Low latency
    * Multi-language support
    * Chat optimization
    * High-quality photorealistic image generation
    * Question & Answer (Q&A)
    * Personally Identifiable Information (PII) removal
    * Text generation
* **Customization Options:**
    * Ability to fine-tune for improved accuracy or creativity.
    * Ease of integrating your own proprietary data.
* **Model Size:**
    * Indicates the amount of data used for training, often measured by parameter count.
* **Licensing Agreements:**
    * Are there any restrictions on the commercial use of the model's output?
* **Context Window (Maximum Tokens):**
    * Refers to the amount of data allowed in a single prompt (maximum number of tokens you can provide).

## Comparing Foundation Models

A direct comparison of model characteristics relevant to your needs is an effective way to narrow down your choices.

### Example: Affordable Text Generation

If your primary goal is **affordable text generation**, you might compare models based on:

* **Supported Use Cases**
* **Supported Languages**
* **Maximum Tokens (Context Window)**
* **Cost of Usage**

**Example Comparison Snapshot (Note: Always check AWS website for latest info!)**

| Model              | Supported Use Cases | Languages | Max Tokens (Context Window) | On-Demand Cost | Notes                                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :-------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon Titan Lite  | Text Generation     | English   | (e.g., 8K)                  | Affordable     | Great affordable option                      |
| Anthropic Claude Instant | Text Generation, More Features | Multi-language | (e.g., 100K)                | Slightly Higher | More features, larger context window         |
| Cohere Command-Lite | Text Generation     | English   | (e.g., 4K)                  | Competitive    | Worth trying                                 |
| Mistral Instruct   | Text Generation     | English   | (e.g., 32K)                 | Same as Titan Lite | More tokens, larger context window than Titan Lite |

**Important Note:** The Generative AI landscape is constantly evolving. Always refer to the official [AWS Bedrock website](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) for the most up-to-date information on model pricing, features, and capabilities.

## Using a Requirements Matrix for Model Selection

A more systematic approach to model selection is to create a **requirements matrix**:

1.  **Identify Your Requirements:** List all the essential capabilities your Generative AI project needs.
    * *Example:* Support for French and Spanish, Q&A capability, PII removal, text generation, support for up to 25,000 input tokens.
2.  **Identify Models for Comparison:** Select a few potential Foundation Models.
3.  **Evaluate and Record:** For each model, mark whether it provides the identified capability (e.g., with a tick or a cross).

This matrix will help you visually narrow down the models that satisfy your criteria, making the selection process more objective.

**Example Requirements Matrix:**

| Capability / Model   | Claude Instant | Amazon Titan Text Express | Cohere Command | ... |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------ | :------------- | :-- |
| Supports French      | ✔              | ✘                         | ✘              |     |
| Supports Spanish     | ✔              | ✘                         | ✘              |     |
| Supports Q&A         | ✔              | ✔                         | ✘              |     |
| Removes PII          | ✔              | ✘                         | ✘              |     |
| Generates Text       | ✔              | ✔                         | ✔              |     |
| Supports 25K Tokens  | ✔              | ✘                         | ✘              |     |
| **Overall Fit** | **Winner!** |                           |                |     |

In this example, Claude Instant emerges as the clear winner by satisfying all specified requirements. This systematic approach helps you identify the best models for experimentation and ultimately, deployment.

## Conclusion

By carefully considering your use case requirements and leveraging the tools and flexibility offered by Amazon Bedrock, you can effectively select the optimal Foundation Model for your Generative AI projects. Always stay informed about the latest model updates and capabilities to ensure you're making the most informed decision.
